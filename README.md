# Background_Scenario_Explanation
This repo contains the details of Background scenario information
Over the course of the past several years, a team comprised of climate scientists, economists, and energy systems modelers 
from around the world has constructed a diverse set of novel "pathways." These pathways delve into the potential transformations
in worldwide society, demographics, and economics anticipated in the next century.Together, they are recognized as the "Shared Socioeconomic Pathways" (SSPs).
Presently, these Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) hold significance as vital inputs for the newest climate models. 
These models are contributing to the publication of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) sixth assessment report, released on 2021. 
Additionally, the SSPs are actively being employed to investigate the impact of societal decisions on greenhouse gas emissions. This exploration aims 
to understand how these choices might influence the attainment of the climate objectives outlined in the Paris Agreement.
The recently introduced SSPs present five potential routes that the world could follow. In contrast to previous scenarios, these pathways 
provide a more extensive perspective on a world continuing "business as usual" without future climate policies. The projected global warming by 2100 spans from a minimum of 3.1°C to a maximum of 5.1°C above pre-industrial levels.

# History of Shared Socioeconomic pathways
In the 1990s, people worked on something called "SRES" scenarios. These scenarios tried to imagine how the world might change in terms of people, money, and pollution. But as time went on, 
these ideas became old and didn't include many big changes that happened in the world over the last 20 years.
In the begining of 2000s, researchers from different parts of the world started making new plans to understand how the world might change by the end of the 21st century.
The "Representative Concentration Pathways" (RCPs), created by one study team, describe various concentrations of greenhouse gases and additional radiative forcings that could happen in the future. They created four routes that, in 2100, 
cover a wide range of forcing (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 watts per meter squared), but they purposely left out any accompanying socioeconomic "narratives" to avoid complicating their work.
Another group focused on creating simulations of how socioeconomic issues would evolve over the coming century. Population, economic development, education, urbanization, and the pace of technical advancement are a few examples. 
These "Shared Socioeconomic Pathways" (SSPs) examine five potential futures and examine how various levels of climate change mitigation might be accomplished when the mitigation goals of RCPs are combined with the SSPs.
The two initiatives were made to work together. By establishing paths for greenhouse gas concentrations, the RCPs essentially predict how much warming might take place by the end of the century. 
While the SSPs determine whether or not emission reductions will be accomplished.

# Future-oriented scenarios
The SSPs are based on the future oriented scenarios. These are Five scenarios which include
# SSP1 : Sustainability – Taking the Green Road (Low challenges to mitigation and adaptation)
The world shifts gradually, but pervasively, toward a more sustainable path, emphasizing more inclusive development that respects perceived environmental boundaries. Management of the global commons slowly improves, educational and health 7
investments accelerate the demographic transition, and the emphasis on economic growth shifts toward a broader emphasis on human well-being. Driven by an increasing commitment to achieving development goals, inequality is reduced both across and within countries. Consumption is oriented toward low material growth and lower resource and energy intensity.
A world of sustainability-focused growth and equality.
# SSP2 : Middle of the Road (Medium challenges to mitigation and adaptation)
The world follows a path in which social, economic, and technological trends do not shift markedly from historical patterns. Development and income growth proceeds unevenly, with some countries making relatively good progress while others fall short of expectations. Global and national institutions work toward but make slow progress in achieving sustainable 
development goals. Environmental systems experience degradation, although there are some improvements and overall the intensity of resource and energy use declines. Global population growth is moderate and levels off in the second half of the century. Income inequality persists or improves only slowly and challenges to reducing vulnerability to societal and environmental changes remain.
  # SSP3 : Regional Rivalry – A Rocky Road (High challenges to mitigation and adaptation)
A resurgent nationalism, concerns about competitiveness and security, and regional conflicts push countries to increasingly focus on domestic or, at most, regional issues. Policies shift over time to become increasingly oriented toward national and regional security issues. Countries focus on achieving energy and food security goals within their own regions at the expense of broader-based development. 
Investments in education and technological development decline. Economic development is slow, consumption is material-intensive, and inequalities persist or worsen over time. Population growth is low in industrialized and high in developing countries. A low international priority for addressing environmental concerns leads to strong environmental degradation in some regions.
   # SSP4 : Inequality – A Road Divided (Low challenges to mitigation, high challenges to adaptation)
Highly unequal investments in human capital, combined with increasing disparities in economic opportunity and political power, lead to increasing inequalities and stratification both across and within countries. Over time, a gap widens between an internationally-connected society that contributes to knowledge- and capital-intensive sectors of the global economy, and a fragmented collection of lower-income, 
poorly educated societies that work in a labor intensive, low-tech economy. Social cohesion degrades and conflict and unrest become increasingly common. Technology development is high in the high-tech economy and sectors. The globally connected energy sector diversifies, with investments in both carbon-intensive fuels like coal and unconventional oil, but also low-carbon energy sources. Environmental policies focus on local issues around middle and high income areas.
   # SSP5 : Fossil-fueled Development – Taking the Highway (High challenges to mitigation, low challenges to adaptation)
This world places increasing faith in competitive markets, innovation and participatory societies to produce rapid technological progress and development of human capital as the path to sustainable development. Global markets are increasingly integrated. There are also strong investments in health, education, and institutions to enhance human and social capital. At the same time, the push for economic and social development is coupled with the exploitation of abundant 
fossil fuel resources and the adoption of resource and energy intensive lifestyles around the world. All these factors lead to rapid growth of the global economy, while global population peaks and declines in the 21st century. Local environmental problems like air pollution are successfully managed. There is faith in the ability to effectively manage social and ecological systems, including by geo-engineering if necessary.
These future oriented scenarios provides a baselines for how things might appear in the absence of climate policy, allowing researchers to investigate the hurdles and potential for climate mitigation and adaptation in each conceivable future scenario when paired with mitigation objectives.

SSP1 and SSP5 anticipate largely positive tendencies in human development, including "significant investments in education and health, rapid economic growth, and well-functioning institutions." They vary in that SSP5 anticipates an energy-intensive, fossil-fuel-based economy, whereas SSP1 anticipates an accelerating transition toward sustainable practices.

SSP3 and SSP4 are more pessimistic in their future economic and social development, with little investment in education or health in poorer countries coupled with a fast-growing population and increasing inequalities.

SSP2 represents a “middle of the road” scenario historical patterns of development are continued throughout the 21st century.

The SSPs were created to represent worlds with varying levels of mitigation and adaptation issues. While the basic SSP scenarios assume no climate policy, researchers sought to see how the underlying socioeconomic factors will impact climate policy implementation.

For example, SSP1 has modest mitigation and adaptation issues because to its rapid technological progress, relative global income equality, and emphasis on environmental sustainability. SSP4, on the other hand, has similar low mitigation issues due to rapid technology progress, but significant climate adaptation challenges due to persisting inequality and poverty in many regions of the world.
